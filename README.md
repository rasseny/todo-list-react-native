# todo-list-react-native
The Todo App is a mobile application built using React Native, allowing users to manage their tasks efficiently. With a clean and intuitive user interface, users can easily add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks.

Task Management: Users can add new tasks by typing in a text input field and pressing a "Add" button. Each task is displayed as an item in a list.
Simple Navigation: The app may include multiple screens or views for additional features such as task categories, filters, or settings. Simple navigation between screens enhances the user experience.
